0.9.6 2001/08/18 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- filtering was case sensitive
	- moving a folder to the top level did not work since
	  i omitted the top "Mail" folder (version 0.9.4)
	- the new Config value 'default_recipient_domain' was not
	  created by first database setup, only via updating

	Features:
	- In-Reply-To header added	
	- file selection boxes remember last selected directory
	  inside the same session. if you restart JaM the corresponding
	  configuried default value will be used again.
	- empty trash
	- deletion of the standard folders is now impossible
	- ask for saving new mail to Drafts if the composse window is
	  closed
	- writing mail based on a Draft
	- create mail templates and write mails based on templates

0.9.5 2001/08/17 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- oops, I missed it using a rfc822 compliant date for
	  outgoing mails
	- filters were only applied on the first value of
	  multi value fields
	- it was not possible to save html filtered mail
	  attachments
	- when replying to a mail with "reply all" all recipients
	  were added to the "To" header field, instead of using
	  'CC' for other recipients than the original sender.

0.9.4 2001/08/16 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- input filter were applied on outgoing mails sometimes
	- filter adding via folder and subject popup menus did
	  not work
	- path values of folders are now computed correctly,
	  when folder with childs move
	- name clashing is prevented now when creating, moving
	  and renaming folders
	- the folder "Mail" is not displayed anymore. it only
	  wastes space and can confuse if someone drops a folder
	  beside it
	
	Features:
	- you can address different .JaMrc files using the environment
	  variable JAMRC. This way you can easily uses several
	  independently instances of JaM as the same user.
	- move mails to folder
	- a default domain name for recipients can be configured
	  (if we had a dialog to do this ;). currently you must update
	  the corresponding value in the Config table.
	  Config.name='default_recipient_domain'

0.9.3 2001/08/15 joern
	New Features:
	- you can configure if pop3 messages should be deleted on
	  the server (in the account dialog)
	- "Input Filters" are now "IO Filters". you can defined
	  output filters which are applied on outgoing mail.
	- reset schema version to 1 (yet possible, because there
	  are no production installations, what will change soon ;)
	- today I throw away my Netscape Mailer

0.9.2 2001/08/14 joern
	New Features:
	- parent folders with child folders which have unread
	  mail can be colored differently. the new configuration
	  parameter pushes schema version to 2.
	- quickly adding new filter rules now via right click folder
	  popup menu. target folder will be set accordingly.
	- quickly adding new filter rules now via right click subjects
	  popup menu. target folder will be set accordingly *and*
	  toccfrom will be set to the "To:" adresse of the clicked mail.
	  this way you create mailing list filters with one click.
	- quick search via right click subjects menu for
	  - sender
	  - subject
	  - body
	  - recipient
