0.9.4 2001/08/16 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- input filter were applied on outgoing mails sometimes
	- filter adding via folder and subject popup menus did
	  not work
	- path values of folders are now computed correctly,
	  when folder with childs move
	- name clashing is prevented now when creating, moving
	  and renaming folders
	- the folder "Mail" is not displayed anymore. it only
	  wastes space and can confuse if someone drops a folder
	  beside it
	
	Features:
	- you can address different .JaMrc files using the environment
	  variable JAMRC. This way you can easily uses several
	  independently instances of JaM as the same user.
	- move mails to folder
	- a default domain name for recipients can be configured
	  (if we had a dialog to do this ;). currently you must update
	  the corresponding value in the Config table.
	  Config.name='default_recipient_domain'

0.9.3 2001/08/15 joern
	New Features:
	- you can configure if pop3 messages should be deleted on
	  the server (in the account dialog)
	- "Input Filters" are now "IO Filters". you can defined
	  output filters which are applied on outgoing mail.
	- reset schema version to 1 (yet possible, because there
	  are no production installations, what will change soon ;)
	- today I throw away my Netscape Mailer

0.9.2 2001/08/14 joern
	New Features:
	- parent folders with child folders which have unread
	  mail can be colored differently. the new configuration
	  parameter pushes schema version to 2.
	- quickly adding new filter rules now via right click folder
	  popup menu. target folder will be set accordingly.
	- quickly adding new filter rules now via right click subjects
	  popup menu. target folder will be set accordingly *and*
	  toccfrom will be set to the "To:" adresse of the clicked mail.
	  this way you create mailing list filters with one click.
	- quick search via right click subjects menu for
	  - sender
	  - subject
	  - body
	  - recipient
