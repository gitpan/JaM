Known bugs:
-----------
- no word encoding on mail headers for outgoing mail
- the "color parents gray" algorithm has a bug: siblings are
  colored too, sometimes.
- on folder change (rename, move, delete etc.) recalculate
  folder context popup. otherwise there are inconsistencies
  e.g. in a opened io filter window.
- if you move all mails away from a folder, its statistic is
  not updated correctly in the folder treeview (press "mark
  all read" as a workaround)

This is my actual TODO list:
----------------------------
- parse mailto links
- address book
- mark a selection of mails as read
- input filter: delete operation
- pop3 error window
- smtp error window
- when selecting last selected message in a folder, don't
  change its status to read
- make browser application configurable
- check RFC:
  - which charset should be used when replying mail?
- use 8 chars for tabs
- make user configuration dialog look nice
- set focus to the subjects list after clicking on a folder
