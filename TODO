Known bugs:
-----------
- zarroo bugs

This is my actual TODO list:
----------------------------
- mark a selection of mails as read
- address book
- input filter: delete operation
- when selecting last selected message in a folder, don't
  change its status to read
- make browser application configurable
- check RFC:
  - which charset should be used when replying mail?
- make user configuration dialog look nice
- set focus to the subjects list after clicking on a folder
- multiple file selection for attachments
- save mail with ctrl+s as temp. draft, so mails can
  survive system crashes (which are really seldom, but
  it's a cool feature at all ;)
