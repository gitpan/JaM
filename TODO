Known bugs:
-----------
- filters are not deleted if the corresponding folder
  is deleted
  => JaM crashes if you select such a filter
     in the IO filter window 
  => I have to append a folder_id column to the IO_Filter
     table. currently this is stored inside the serialized
     IO_Folder object. so it's uncomfortable to find all
     filters which refer to a folder :( well, a real native
     OO database would be fine ;)
- no word encoding on mail headers for outgoing mail
- the "color parents gray" algorithm has a bug: siblings are
  colored too, sometimes.
- on folder change (rename, move, delete etc.) recalculate
  folder context popup. otherwise there are inconsistencies
  e.g. in a opened io filter window.
- if you move all mails away from a folder, its statistic is
  not updated correctly in the folder treeview (press "mark
  all read" as a workaround)
- folder werden beim verschieben umbenannt

This is my actual TODO list:
----------------------------
- save mail with ctrl+s as temp. draft, so mails can
  survive system crashes (which are really seldom, but
  it's a cool feature at all ;)
- parse mailto links
- parse https links (or generic: URIs ;)
- address book
- mark a selection of mails as read
- input filter: delete operation
- pop3 error window
- smtp error window
- when selecting last selected message in a folder, don't
  change its status to read
- make browser application configurable
- check RFC:
  - which charset should be used when replying mail?
- use 8 chars for tabs
- make user configuration dialog look nice
- set focus to the subjects list after clicking on a folder
