<h2>Abstract</h2>

JaM uses a MySQL database to manage its data. It can create
a database for you or you use an existent database. With
the "Edit Database Information" dialog you configure the
database connection information and initialize a new database.
<p>
It is recommended to create a database especially for JaM,
otherwise table or index names may clash with existing objects.

<h2>1. Provide connection information</h2>

First of all enter the DBI Data Source, Username and Password
to connect your MySQL database. The default for DBI Data Source
is "dbi:mysql:jam", but you can change it, e.g. if your database
is not installed on localhost or behind a DBI::Proxy. Refer
to the manpage of DBD::mysql for information about DBI data
sources for MySQL databases.
<p>
This information will be stored in the file ~/.JaMrc, so JaM
will be able to connect the database without asking you again.

<h2>2. Test your configuration</h2>

Press the button "Test" to test your connection information. A
connection will be established and terminated immediately. If
everything works ok, a corresponding message will appear in the
"Status" area. Otherweise an error message will be displayed there.

<h2>3. Create your database</h2>

If you want to create a new database for JaM, press the "Create DB"
Button. You can skip this step, if you want to use an existent database.
If a database with this name does already exist, a error message
will be thrown and the existent database will not be touched.

<h2>4. Create tables</h2>

The last step is creating the tables for JaM. Press the "Create Tables"
button and they will be created inside the database you have chosen.

<h2>That's all, Folks</h2>

Almost ;) If you change the database connection information at runtime (not in
the initialization phase) you have to restart JaM.
