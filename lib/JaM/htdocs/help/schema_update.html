<h2>What's a "Database Schema Update"?</h2>

Obviously you installed a newer version of JaM, which is always
a good idea. Sometimes new versions of JaM need updated database
objects, e.g. new columns or new tables or something similar.
<p>
JaM detected that you use a newer version of JaM with an older
version of the database objects. JaM automatically can update your
database schema. Although JaM is very carefully in updating your
data it can happen, that the update procedure fails, possibly
damaging your data.
<p>
So you may want to make an update of your JaM database before
proceeding. Use the following command to make a full backup
of a MySQL database:
<p>
<pre>
  mysqldump -q -u <i>username</i> -p <i>password</i> \\
            <i>database_name</i> > backup.sql
</pre>
